The maps will be stored in a XML format (https://pugixml.org). The level will reference the SmartTextures ID. An example:

<Map name = "Example Level">
    <Background>ExampleLevelBackground</Background>
    <Prop type = "Static" x = 100 y = 150>ExampleLevelBuilding</Prop>
    <Prop type = "Spawn" x = 20 y = 80>ExampleLevelSpawnPoint</Prop>
</Map>

What information does a Prop need to know in order to create stuff?
1) Texture. A) That's the main element in the prop tags.
2) Where should it be placed? Co-ordinates in 
3) Is it collidable? This can be true or false. In an attribute.
4) Any special properties (E.g. spawn point)? Should these really be handled by a single class? These need such spefic programming that it would be more complex to keep a single class.

How should the XML look?

<Map name = "Map Layout" Width = 1000 Height = 650>
    <Prop Collides=true X = 10 Y = 10>TestHouseRuins</Prop>
    <Spawn X = 20 Y = 10 Type = "Player">Spawner</Spawn>
    <Spawn X = 200 Y = 1000 Type = "Enemy">Spawner</Spawn>
</Map>
