The maps will be stored in a xML format (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/index.htm). The level will reference the SmartTextures ID. An example:

What information does a Prop need to know in order to create stuff?
1) Texture. A) That's the main element in the prop tags.
2) Where should it be placed? Co-ordinates in 
3) Is it collidable? This can be true or false. In an attribute.
4) Any special properties (E.g. spawn point)? Should these really be handled by a single class? These need such spefic programming that it would be more complex to keep a single class.

How should the xML look?

<Map name = "Map Layout" width = "1000" height = "650">
    <Prop collides="true" x = "10" y = "10">TestHouseRuins</Prop>
    <Prop collides="true" x = "10" y = "10">TestHouseRuins</Prop>
    <Prop collides="true" x = "10" y = "10" type = "static" delay = "0.5">TestFountainRuins</Prop>
    <Spawn x = "20" y = "10" type = "Player">Spawner</Spawn>
    <Spawn x = "200" y = "1000" type = "Enemy">Spawner</Spawn>
</Map>

Static attribute means that it is not animated, dynamic is animated and has what the delay should be inbetween frame switching.
