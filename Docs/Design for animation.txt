1 frame = 1 rect.

What do I need for the animator:
 - Texture Rects.
 - The size of each Texture Rect.
 - Time that each frame of the animation is visable for - (float seconds).
 - How many frames in the animation there are.
 - A way to trigger each animation.
 - A way to identify each animation (A string).
 - A default frame/animation.

Animation releating to one thing (e.g. the player) should be stored in file (.png).
The rect of the start animation, the length of the animation (in frames), and the time each frame should be shown for.
