There are 3 main ways of loading in textures:

    [1] Load in a texture off of the storage device each time it's needed -
        Pros:
            - Simple.
        Cons:
            - Slow.

    [2] Create a cache of textures, if a texture has already been loaded create a refence to it else load it in then -
        pros:
            - Speed increase.
            - Memory Efficent.
        Cons:
            - Could cause slow down at run time the the first time a texture is used.

    [3] Preload all textures into a cache, before the player starts to play the game - 
        pros:
            - removes slow down at play time from accessing a storage device.
            - Memory Effiecent.
        
        Cons:
            - Higher room for human error.
            - Increased loading time.

Answer of today shall be [3]. Human error will be noticable and easily fixable, the loading time will not be increased as much as play time slow down would be if [1] or [2] was used.
